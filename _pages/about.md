Hi! I am an incoming graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, supervised by Florian Shkurti and Tim Barfoot. My studies are funded by the CGS-M Scholarships and Department of Computer Science. I am engaged in building intelligent robotics systems, specifically developing learning algorithms that can teach robots to safely and autonomously complete complex tasks like perception, planning, and navigation. I also like skiing and playing chess.   

I am fortunate to have been advised by fantastic researchers throughout my undergraduate studies. Most recently, I worked with Florian Shkurti on continual reinforcement learning for robots in nonstationary environments. Previously, I interned at Qualcomm Canada from 2019 to 2020, building software tools to speed up deep learning inference on Snapdragon processors. I was also involved in the AutoDrive Challenge at the University of Toronto, where I trained custom 2D/3D pedestrian detectors. Our team won the competition three years in a row. Before this, I spent a wonderful summer at Technion, Israel at Amir Degani's lab. I completed a project on navigating a Crazyflie nano quadcopter to pollinate flowers with an Intel RealSense camera. At the University of Toronto, I also worked with Angela Schoellig on building a flight simulator and testbed for Crazyflies.
